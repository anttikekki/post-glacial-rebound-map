    "text": "Land uplift refers to the slow rise of the Earth's crust occurring in Northern Europe and Canada, caused by the rebound of the Earth's crust that was depressed under the weight of the last Ice Age glacier. As a result of land uplift, the shoreline retreats on the Finnish coast by approximately 9–3 mm per year. The uplift is fastest in the Vaasa region and slowest in Southern Finland.",
